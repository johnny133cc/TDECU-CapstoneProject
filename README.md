# TDECU AI-Powered Caption Generation System

## 📋 Overview

Our capstone team partnered with Texas Dow Employees Credit Union (TDECU), now rebranding as Space City Financial, to help rebuild their LinkedIn presence following a major merger.
We developed an AI-powered caption generation system that streamlines social media content creation for employees while maintaining brand consistency and compliance.
