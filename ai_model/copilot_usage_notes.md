# Copilot Usage Notes

This document provides key usage guidelines and tips for integrating and using the AI-powered Caption Creator and Compliance Checker agents in the TDECU Caption Generation System. These notes aim to ensure smooth operation and optimal use of the AI models.

## **1. Overview of the AI Agents**

### **Caption Creator (AI Agent 1)**
- **Purpose:** The Caption Creator generates engaging and concise captions based on provided content, designed for TDECU's social media or other public-facing posts.
- **Functionality:** 
  - Generates captions that are professional yet casual, relevant to the content, and appropriate for TDECU's tone and audience.
  - It ensures the captions are **under 250 characters** while being **engaging** and **clear**.
  - Uses emojis where appropriate to increase engagement.
  - Avoids offensive or inappropriate language and rephrases content to create new captions without altering the original message.

### **Compliance Checker (AI Agent 2)**
- **Purpose:** The Compliance Checker ensures the captions generated by the Caption Creator adhere to TDECU's compliance standards, specifically around sensitive content.
- **Functionality:** 
  - It scans captions for **sensitive financial data**, **proprietary information**, and **offensive language**.
  - If sensitive content is found, the system replaces it with **generic terms** (e.g., “a significant amount,” “several sessions”).
  - Ensures that the captions are written in **third-person** (e.g., replacing “We hosted an event” with “TDECU hosted an event”).
  - Returns only the revised caption, with no extra commentary or explanation.

## **2. Integration Process**

### **Integrating the Caption Creator and Compliance Checker:**
- **Flow 1: Caption Creation**
  - Input: A prompt asking the Caption Creator to generate a caption based on a given piece of content. The content may include text from articles, blogs, or other written content.
  - Output: The Caption Creator generates a new, concise caption, keeping it under 250 characters while making it engaging and relevant.
  
- **Flow 2: Compliance Checking**
  - Input: After receiving the caption from the Caption Creator, the Compliance Checker is triggered by another prompt to evaluate whether the generated caption adheres to compliance standards.
  - Output: The Compliance Checker outputs a revised caption with any sensitive information removed and maintains the intended message and tone.

## **3. Key Considerations for Using the AI Agents**

### **1. Content Input for Caption Creation**
- Ensure that the content you input to the Caption Creator is **well-structured** and **clear** to allow for the generation of accurate captions.
- If the content is too long, try to break it down into shorter sections or highlight key points that you want emphasized in the caption.

### **2. Compliance Checking Considerations**
- The Compliance Checker works best when there is clear content that could potentially include sensitive information. If the caption includes product names or specific financial data, be sure to feed it through the Compliance Checker to ensure it meets TDECU’s compliance standards.
- **Important:** The Compliance Checker will **replace sensitive financial details** or **proprietary information** with more general terms but will not alter general public-facing details or numbers like participant counts.

### **3. Limitations**
- The AI agents are not capable of **understanding the deeper context** behind the content; they only rephrase or check for specific patterns. It's essential to ensure that the input content is clear and does not require nuanced understanding or judgment from the agents.
- **Character Limitations:** Captions generated by the Caption Creator must be concise (under 250 characters) while still capturing the essence of the content. This requires careful attention to brevity and clarity.

## **4. Best Practices**

- **Be Specific in Prompts:** Provide clear and specific content for the AI agents to process. The more structured and clear the input, the more accurate and relevant the output will be.
- **Review Generated Captions:** Although the AI agents are designed to generate and check captions, always review the output to ensure it aligns with TDECU’s brand voice and values.
- **Stay Updated on Compliance Guidelines:** Ensure that you are always using the most up-to-date compliance standards when feeding captions to the Compliance Checker. Regulations or guidelines may evolve, and it's crucial to keep the system aligned.
