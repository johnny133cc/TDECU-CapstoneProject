# Project Summary

## Overview

Our capstone project partnered with Texas Dow Employees Credit Union (TDECU), now rebranding as Space City Financial, to address challenges related to their brand transition following a merger with Space City Credit Union. The merger resulted in a significant loss of LinkedIn visibility due to the creation of a new company page with substantially fewer followers than the original.

To support TDECU’s goal of rebuilding their social media presence while maintaining brand consistency and compliance, we developed an AI-powered caption generation system. This system leverages approved content from TDECU’s internal intranet (“The Vault”), press releases, and blogs to automatically create compliant, on-brand social media captions. Employees access the captions via a centralized SharePoint repository, and automated notifications encourage active employee participation in content sharing.

## Key Features

- **Intranet Content Integration:** Pulls from existing approved internal content sources to ensure brand alignment.
- **Automated Caption Generation:** Uses AI to produce social media captions that adhere to brand voice and compliance standards.
- **Centralized Repository:** Captions are stored in SharePoint for easy employee access.
- **Notification System:** Automated alerts prompt employees to share new content, increasing engagement.
- **Security and Compliance:** The system operates strictly within TDECU’s security protocols and uses only public or communications-approved content.

## Stakeholder Collaboration

Successful development involved close collaboration with TDECU stakeholders, including:

- Marketing President (Project Lead)
- Principal, Technology Innovation & Executive Support (Technical Advisor)
- Technology Program Manager (Access and Communication Liaison)

## Business Impact

This solution is designed to:

- Increase LinkedIn followers, impressions, and employee sharing rates.
- Enhance brand visibility and sentiment during a critical rebranding phase.
- Reduce manual workload on marketing teams by streamlining content creation and distribution.

## Future Enhancements

Potential upgrades identified during the project include:

- Expanding caption generation to other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
- Developing an analytics dashboard to monitor content performance and engagement.
- Incorporating recommended images to accompany captions.
- Implementing A/B testing features to optimize caption effectiveness.

## Conclusion

The AI-powered caption generation system effectively supports TDECU’s digital engagement and brand reestablishment efforts while prioritizing security and compliance. With targeted refinements and a full rollout, it can drive sustained growth in employee-driven social media presence and overall brand momentum.
