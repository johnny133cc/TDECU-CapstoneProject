# Project Summary

## Overview

Our capstone project partnered with Texas Dow Employees Credit Union (TDECU), now rebranding as Space City Financial, to address challenges related to their brand transition following a merger with Space City Credit Union. The merger resulted in a significant loss of LinkedIn visibility due to the creation of a new company page with substantially fewer followers than the original.

To support TDECU‚Äôs goal of rebuilding their social media presence while maintaining brand consistency and compliance, we developed an AI-powered caption generation system. This system leverages approved content from TDECU‚Äôs internal intranet (‚ÄúThe Vault‚Äù), press releases, and blogs to automatically create compliant, on-brand social media captions. Employees access the captions via a centralized SharePoint repository, and automated notifications encourage active employee participation in content sharing.
